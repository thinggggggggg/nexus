In order to work, first clone repo into folder locally. Then set up venv (on Windows: 'py -m venv venv' in terminal from repo folder).

Open a py file and click the interpreter on the bottom right, then select the venv interpreter. 

Install packages by checking in all py files (requirements.txt will be made at some point for this...)

Now it should work. Just type 'flask run' in terminal, then open 'http://localhost:5000' on your device. 

Backend will be connected soon...
